# CS-230-Portfolio_Submission

The client was a gaming company called The Gaming Room. They wanted to design a web-based, team-based game app that would be cross-platform and able to render high-resolution images, manage player and team data, and ensure security and performance.

I felt that the best part of my process in developing this documentation involved the information I learned through the research it took to provide proper responses to the prompts in the document.

The design document helped me understand what to expect when making revisions to the code. The experience of first writing specifications, then coding, was noticeably smoother.
Early on, I was more focused on the platform independence of the programming language. I took another course – CS-340 – this term that forced me to really dig deep in understanding backend development and administration in ways that would have shifted the focus more towards those areas of discussion, in earlier parts of the design document’s development. 

Considering the impact of memory, storage, security, and performance at the interface between client and server – all of these things ultimately impact UX. Without the user experience, delivered, nothing else adds up.

I used a smallest-to-largest approach when focusing on the parts of the project needing attention, when designing software solutions in the course. I would like to learn more about Java’s networking usage capabilities, I think would be of great benefit in understanding how Java will run such applications as that in the course.

Great course - especially in tandem with CS-340 this term. Thanks, Professor!
